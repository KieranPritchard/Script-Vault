# Script: Coding Project Organiser

## Description of Script:

### Objective

To create a script that will allow me to organsise my code projects automatcally, with miniumal interact from me. I also want to be able to take it further, wether it's adding new updates to the functions or if it's tweaking it to run automatically.

### Features

* Easily sorts out your general code projects folder for you.
* It moves files to where they need to go.
* Allows for simplfied maintaining of projects. 

### Technologies and Tools Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks/Librarys:** Shutil and os

### Challenges Faced

Turning it into what it was supposed to be. In the last iteration of this script, it lost its way because I thought I could bring three or four script ideas together. However, as it worked out it didn't. so, I decided to take the script back to what I orignally invisioned.

### Outcome

Used Python and the modules listed to create this script, I also rebuild this script to fit an earlier vision before I tryed to make it a one size fits all solution. Another thing, I can update this easier then the other version.

## How to use Script:

1. **Set Up Your Enviroment:**
    * Make sure you have Python Installed at the latest version, if not install from www.python.org.
2. **Run The Script:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory where the script is located.
    * Run with the following command: `python general_coding_project_organiser.py`
3. **Clean Up Unnecessary Files:**
    * The script will automatically scan the directory and remove unnecessary files such as `.tmp`, `.log`, `.bak`, and `.DS_Store`.
4. **Verify Your Project Directory:**
    * Check your project folder to confirm that unwanted files have been removed.
