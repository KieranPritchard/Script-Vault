# Script: Coding Project Organiser

## Description of Script:

This script is used to organise my coding projects, so they all follow the same folder/file structure. 

My reason for programming this, was to help me make sure all my projects sort into and follow a certain file structure. My plan with this script going forward is if i end up learning technologys that have to adhere to certain directory structures.

The biggest challenge i have had with this script, was to condense elements of it and make it modular. i overcame this problem by breaking up parts of the `move_files_to_general_folders()` into seperate functions, a solution I will implement on other functions similer to this one on other projects. 

## How to use Script:
