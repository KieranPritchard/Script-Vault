### Challenges Faced

Turning it into what it was supposed to be. In the last iteration of this script, it lost its way because I thought I could bring three or four script ideas together. However, as it worked out it didn't. so, I decided to take the script back to what I orignally invisioned.

### Outcome

Used Python and the modules listed to create this script, I also rebuild this script to fit an earlier vision before I tryed to make it a one size fits all solution. Another thing, I can update this easier then the other version.
