## Project Description

This repostiory is collection of all my scripts and automations, they are designed to help streamline and improve my workflows. 

One of my reasons for this constantly ongoing project, is to cut down on having to repeatedly do the same boring tasks constandly. Another reason is to learn and refine my scripting abilitys in python, bash, and more as my needs change.

Each project has its own "ReadMe.md", which you can find the links too in the contents table below.
